abstract = "The tracking of birds using light-level geolocators has become a relatively frequent technique in the study of migratory shorebirds. The geolocator program, commenced in Australia by the Victorian Wader Studies Group in 2009, has provided insights into many of the strategies and outcomes of the species studied. The most numerous of these studies have been on the Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres. While an increasing number of these are multiple tracks for the same bird, there are relatively few with field sightings to enable supporting calibration and confirmation of computed locations, hence the value of the sightings in Newcastle of Ruddy Turnstone with leg flag WMA described in this paper. The migrations of this bird, described over three consecutive years, show southward tracks over the Pacific Ocean and stopovers in Newcastle on its return journeys to King Island (Tasmania). Information regarding breeding locations and incubation characteristics are also described. "
