I am an ecologist with special interest in empirical and theoretical research on bird migration and their interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment. Iâ€™m interested in the factors that shape migration, the individual fitness effects of particular migration strategies and how it subsequently affects population dynamics. At the moment, my major focus is on trying to understand how climatic or human-driven changes along migratory routes may affect individual migration behaviours and fates.
