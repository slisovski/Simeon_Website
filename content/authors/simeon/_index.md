My major research interests are the migration of animals and factors that determine their routes, timing and ultimately the faith of individuals and their populations. Iâ€™m particularly interested in combining theoretical, experimental and observational studies to asses the consequences of global change on avian migrants and their communities. Furthermore, I study the impacts of pathogens on migratory birds and how infections may affect their strategies as well as their capacity to spread e.g. viruses across large distances.

As a Geo.X Young Academy Research Fellow and a Postdoc at the Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research, I am looking at various, mostly remote sensed, data sources to extract indices of seasonal dynamics of the environment and quantify changes therein across the globe. In parallel, I aim to setup a field research project in the Lena Delta (Siberia) to validate the results and quantify the consequenses of phenological changes for Arctic ecosystem structure and function.
