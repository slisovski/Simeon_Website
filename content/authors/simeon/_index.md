I am a quantitative ecologist specialized in the fields of avian migration, theoretical ecology and host-pathogen interactions. My research aims to improve our understanding of the natural world and particularly how animals interact with their biotic and abiotic environments. I enjoy to integrate of empirical fieldwork, remote sensing data and theoretical models at continental and global scales. My toolkit includes animal tracking analysis and light-level geolocation in particular, big data analyses, stochastic dynamic programing, Bayesian statistics and epidemiological models.
