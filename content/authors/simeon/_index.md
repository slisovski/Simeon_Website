My major research interests are the migration of animals and factors that determine their routes, timing and ultimately the faith of individuals and their populations. Iâ€™m particularly interested in combining theoretical, experimental and observational studies to asses the consequences of pathogens and global change on avian migrants and their communities.

As a [Geo.X](https://www.geo-x.net/en/) Young Academy Research Fellow and a Postdoc at the Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar and Marine Research, I am working on topics related to seasonal dynamics and quantifications of changes across the globe. In parallel, I am starting a field campaign in eastern Siberia to validate the results and assess the consequenses of phenological changes for Arctic ecosystem structure and function.
