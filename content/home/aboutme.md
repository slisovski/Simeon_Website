I am an early-career scientist with special interest in empirical and theoretical research on bird migration and interactions with their biotic and abiotic environment. Iâ€™m interested in the (proximate) factors that shape migration, the individual fitness effects of particular migration strategies and how it subsequently affects population dynamics. Furthermore, I try to understand how climatic or human-driven changes along migratory routes may affect individual migration behaviours and fates. Currently, I am also working on the quantification of the potential of migrants to spread pathogens across large distances using a dynamic state dynamic modelling approach (stochastic dynamic modelling).
